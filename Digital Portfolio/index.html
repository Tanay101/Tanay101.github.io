    <center><h1>Why this digital portfolio is important</h1></center>
    <p style="margin-right:3em;margin-left:3em;font-size:30px;">
      This portfolio is important as it helps me keep a log of all the work that I have completed. Along with that I will be able to neatly and cleanly organize my journal entries. Finally this is also a way to help express my self and showcase my skills. Also digitals portfolio are highly important as they allow you to save your work over time in a online place. I will also be using this throughout my high school career, and can use this on my future resumes or work applications.
