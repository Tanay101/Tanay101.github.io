            <h2>The Basics of Recommendation Algorithims</h2>
            <p>
                Internet users access many sites that often provide info or content of some sort. Varying from search
                engines
                to e-commerce sites, and social media these platforms can include sites such as Google, Instagram,
                Amazon,
                eBay,
                TikTok, and a wide variety of many more. On these sites, the content that is shown to the user has to be
                decided
                by an algorithm. This algorithm is based upon a variety of metrics that range from user retention,
                click-through rate, watch-time, interaction, etc. For example, if I were to search Amazon for new shoes
                it
                would most likely show me a popular brand such as Nike or Adidas as these are often the most purchased
                and
                amplified brand. Overall each algorithm is refined to best optimize a certain metric that the creators
                wish
                to
                meet, however, there are two distinct types of algorithms. The first type is collaborative filtering.
                This
                is
                where the content that a user receives is based on the preferences and behaviors of other users. For
                instance,
                if I wanted to get a dog the Google algorithm would likely recommend dog leashes, food, etc. that many
                others
                found beneficial. The second type of recommendation algorithm is that of Content-Based filtering.
                This is where the algorithm recommends items based on past searches and preferences. For instance, If I
                was
                browsing TikTok and I liked every post about basketball I would continue to recommend more basketball
                videos.
                The way such algorithms can function is through the use of neural networks which can make complex
                calculations to decide what content to provide. One of the biggest ways that such algorithms are
                possible is
                through large-scale data collection to help make accurate predictions about every user. However, in more
                recent
                years privacy concerns have arisen from the public resulting in new laws starting to be put in place.

            <h2>The Feedback Loop</h2>
            <p>
                Once a user begins to interact with an algorithm a Feedback loop begins to start. When a user engages
                with a
                certain piece of type of content the algorithm understands this and begins to suggest similar content to
                the
                user in a continuing cycle. This continual cycle of the algorithm altering its recommendations based on
                data
                collection will occur and can allow for more enjoyable content for the user. However, this often leads
                to an
                effect known as the "filter bubble" or "echo chamber". This is where a user is only shown content
                aligning
                with
                their views which only strengthens their views, and further limits exposure to new perspectives. Over
                time
                this content can become more extreme leading to potentially harmful and dangerous repercussions. For
                example, if
                a person only were to watch content from a single political candidate they may fall under the assumption
                that
                the candidate is the only option, and they will not expand their perspective.

            <h2>Conspiracy Theories &amp; Algorithmic Amplification</h2>
            <p>
                One of the largest problems with recommendation algorithms is that they seek to earn as much monetary
                gain
                as possible for the site. This means prioritizing interesting and intriguing stories rather than factual
                information. In a perfect world, this would not be a problem where only factual stories are posted, but
                often
                provocative and false stories are consistently posted. This leads to a problem as people who watch one
                video based on a conspiracy theory might get many similar videos leading to the amplification of the
                theory
                since Conspiracy theories often have very high retention increasing revenue for sites. For example, a
                person
                who
                watches a video claiming that the moon landing is fake might slightly be inclined to believe it was fake
                based
                on that video. Following this though, the user is often bombarded with many more videos claiming the
                moon
                landing is fake leading to a confirmation bias within the user that the moon landing is actually fake
                even
                though such a claim is absurd.

            <h2>Platform Incentives</h2>
            <p>
                Based upon the company, the algorithm may value certain metrics more highly than others, but usually,
                they
                are
                trying to boost revenue through watch time as this generates the most money for the company. These
                algorithms
                will combine a variety of metrics to achieve the desired result. For example, YouTube will often show
                videos
                that interest the user so that the user stays on the site longer, and views more ads resulting in
                profit.
                The
                problem with this is that often items such as the truthfulness of videos are not taken into account
                leading to the spread of misinformation. This widespread misinformation is often where conspiracy
                theories
                and
                other radical ideas begin and continue to thrive.

            <h2>Potential for Exploitation </h2>
            <p>
                One significant with these systems is there is a large potential for exploitation. Malicious individuals
                often
                try their best to manipulate algorithms with misinformation. They can do this through the use of
                click-bait titles, false thumbnails, provocative content, and various other ideas. This manipulates the
                algorithm as the video's sensationalism often increases viewer watch time resulting in the algorithm
                wanting
                to
                spread more of the similar content that many viewers consume. This can result in many people listening
                and
                believing in the wildest of conspiracy theories. For example, a video titled "Understanding COVID-19:
                Facts,
                Prevention, and Current Research" might not be very interesting for viewers, but a title labeled
                "Shocking
                COVID-19 Revelation: The Dark Secrets They Don't Want You to Know!" might be more clicked by viewers as
                it
                appears more interesting, mysterious, and shocking.
