      I recieved assistance from: No one
<br>
      I assisted: Aryan Verma

      1.1:You have to add the ones place then carry over any extra numbers. Then you repeat this step for all digits.
<br>
2.1:When adding octal numbers you have to carry over when you reach 8 instead of 10 because you only have 8 different digits.
<br>
3.1:You have to carry over in hexadecimal when you reach a 16. This is because hex has 16 digits instead of 10. Also you have to remember to include letter for digits greater than 9.
<br>
  4.1:You have to remeber that it only has two different digits so if you get a two you have to carry that number over to a new spot.                                                                                                                                                <br>

      What did I learn? I learned how to convert numbers between different systems
<br>
      What challenges did I encounter?I had challenges trying to convert between binary and decimal
<br>
      How could this experience be improved?Some videos could help
<br>
How has what I learned affected my thinking?I now understand different types of number systems
