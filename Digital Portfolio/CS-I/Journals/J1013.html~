      What did I learn? I learned about the many symbols used to represent the boolean logics of Algebra.
<br>
      What challenges did I encounter? Some of the symbols were very confusing to understand
<br>
      How could this experience be improved? Elaborate more on the symbols
<br>
How has what I learned affected my thinking? I now understand more boolean logic
