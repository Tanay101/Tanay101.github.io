<h2>1.1 What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Carry column?</h2>
<br>
It has the same standard output as an AND gate would have.
<h2>1.2 What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Sum column?</h2>
<br>
It has the same standard output as a OR gate would have.
<h2>2.1 What do you notice about the relationship between the first-half (top four rows) of the full-adder as compared to all of the rows of the half-adder?</h2>
<br>
The outputs for both of the tables are exactly the same and resemble each other.
<h2>2.2 Why is this true?</h2>
<br>
This is because the first column is not being used during these four outputs so it will produce the same output as the half-adder.
<h2>3.1 Why does the least significant bit position use a half-adder rather than a full-adder?</h2>
<br>
This is because in the first spot we only have two inputs so it will only need a half-adder.
<h2>3.2 Assume that proper inputs are applied for all bits in numbers A and B. Will the correct output from S be available instantaneously? If not, why not?</h2>
<br>
No, because these values wait on the processes occurng to the right. It is a chain reaction so it will take time for the chain to reach the end to get the S value.
<h2>3.3 Assume that we have a standard (non-scientific calculator) capable of adding two 16-bit words. Two numbers, A and B, are added together. After the addition, it is noted that C15  is high. What can we infer? What is this state commonly called?</h2>
<br>
It can be inferred that all of our inputs were true resulting in a very large number that the calculator could not handle.
<h2>What did I learn?</h2>
I learned about the various uses of hald-adders and full-adders in computers and how they function.
<br>
<h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
<br>
At first it was very difficult to understand the many truth tables presented. It was an overwhelming amount of information.
<br>
<h2>    How could this experience be improved?</h2>
<br>
Including videos or an in class lecture would be useful to help understanding this complex topic.
<br>
<h2>How has what I learned affected my thinking?
</h2>
<br>
I now understand the various ways computers function and why it can take a long time to proces a simple math equation.
